/*
 This file previously contained an HTML document which caused TypeScript/JSX
 parser errors because the file has a .js extension. To fix editor errors,
 the corrected HTML has been added as `departmentcse.html` in the same folder.

 You can safely delete or rename this file to `departmentcse.html` if you
 intended it to be an HTML page. Keeping this short JS file prevents
 the TypeScript language server from reporting HTML-in-JS errors.
